### 🚀 Overview

**Tiny Raw Node.js** is a high-performance, framework-less Uptime Monitoring API. It’s built to monitor whether your favorite websites are up or down and notify you instantly.

The core philosophy of this project is to master **Node.js Internals** by avoiding high-level frameworks like Express and building everything—from the router to the database—using only Node.js Core Modules.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Zero Dependencies:** No `npm install`. Built with 100% pure Node.js.
- **Dual-Core Architecture:** A standalone **Server** to handle API requests and a dedicated **Worker** to handle background pings.
- **Custom File-DB:** A handwritten library for CRUD operations using the `fs` module.
- **Security First:** SHA256 password hashing and secure token-based authentication.
- **Protocol Flexibility:** Support for both HTTP and HTTPS monitoring.
